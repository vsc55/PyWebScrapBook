## Usage

### Install Python

Install Python >= 3.6 from the [official site](https://www.python.org).

Add python to PATH so that it can be run from the command line interface (CLI).

### Install this package

Run below command from CLI to install (or upgrade to) the latest version:

    python -m pip install -U webscrapbook

After installation, `wsb`, `webscrapbook`, and `wsbview` will be available from the CLI.

### Install Docker

Starting a PyWebScrapBook instance is simple:

    docker run --name webscrapbook -d -v /dokers/webscrapbook_data:/data -p 8080:8080/tcp vsc55/webscrapbook:latest

### Host a scrapbook

Switch current working directory (CWD) to a directory you'd like to host.

    cd /path/to/scrapbook

> In Windows, an additional command to change drive might be required. For example, if the directory to host is `D:\path\to\scrapbook` while the current drive is `C`, an additional command `D:` is requied besides `cd D:\path\to\scrapbook`.
>
> You can also use the shortcurt: `Shift + Right-click` on the desired folder and select `Open command window here` or `Open PowerShell window here`.

Generate config files for the directory:

    wsb config -ba

> This step can be skipped if you want PyWebScrapBook default data structure instead. See [doc wiki](https://github.com/danny0838/webscrapbook/wiki/Backend) for more details.

Run `.wsb/serve.py` to start the server, or run below command from CLI:

    wsb serve

### Open archive file directly

Run `which wsbview` (or `where wsbview` in Windows) from CLI to get the command path. Set default application of MAFF/HTZ file to the command at that path to open them directly in the browser with double-click.

### Further documentation

Run below command for help about available commands:

    wsb --help

For documentation about configs, run:

    wsb help config
